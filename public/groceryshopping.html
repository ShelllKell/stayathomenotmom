                    <p>Today, I braved the task of attempting to grocery shop…<i>ALONE</i>. I know what you’re thinking, <i>“Oh my gosh Shelby, that sounds so daunting”, “What are you going to do with your not-kids the whole time?”, “What if you have a perfectly organized cart with no extra items that tiny hands grabbed on the way down the aisle?!?”</i> I know, I know. I’ve thought these things to myself too. Taking my not-kids (literally no children) to the store with me seemed like a task that only Super Woman could do, but I was up for the challenge. Being a stay-at-home not mom is a lot harder than it looks. I’ve noticed going to the grocery store to get food for my family can be so frustrating and chaotic with the not-kids there by my not-side. So, I figured I would give you a glimpse into my food pursuit to show all you other not-moms out there that it’s ok, we’re all in this together and just doing the best we can.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Strolling (Not to be mistaken with Stroll<i>er</i>)</h2>

                    <p>I find myself with an unlimited amount of time in the grocery store. So annoying, right? Like, why can't I have a soccer practice to get to in 45 minutes so I'm in and out - boom - with just what I need. Nooooo, being a stay-at-home not mom requires minimal time contraints on almost everything, so I was free to stroll as much as I wanted through Sprouts. Fine.</p>

                    <p>I grabbed my cart and plopped Kate inside, securely, and adjusted it according to the warning about child (and not-child) safety. Buckle up, Kate! </p>

                    <img class="img-responsive" src="img/groceryshopping/bag.jpg" alt="">
                    <span class="caption text-muted">They forgot to include not-children on the warning label. I'll let it slide.</span>

                    <p>I headed on over the meat counter to pick up lunches for the week. I didn't need much, being that I only have two mouths to feed, but found myself waiting in an extra long line. I had zero mini humans to entertain so I had all this obnoxious, quiet, free time to entertain myself the best way I knew how while I waited.</p>

                    <span class="caption text-muted">A neat instagram page I found while peacefully waiting for deli meat.</span>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">When life hands you lemons...</h2>

                    <p>I was strolling through the store getting all the items checked off my list and found I was so fatigued by the minial amount of effort it took to complete my task. I couldn't take it any longer and took a much needed coffee break. Stay-at-home not moms require a standard amount of basic, overpriced Starbucks lattes to get through even the most mundane tasks. I mean, what else am I going to spend my not-kids money on?</p>

                    <img class="img-responsive" src="img/groceryshopping/lemons.jpg" alt="">
                    <span class="caption text-muted">You know what they say - when Sprouts gives you lemons, drink your Starbucks.</span>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Damnit Kate</h2>

                    <p>After I felt like I could get through the rest of the trip without being too cranky, Kate started acting up. I swear, what is it with purses? It's like the minute you take them to the store they forget how to act. I was constantly pulling her strap off of things so they wouldn't knock over and spill everywhere. My patience was running <i>thin.</i></p>

                    <img class="img-responsive" src="img/groceryshopping/olives.jpg" alt="">
                    <span class="caption text-muted">I caught Kate almost spilling olives all over the floor.</span>

                    <img class="img-responsive" src="img/groceryshopping/cheese.jpg" alt="">
                    <span class="caption text-muted">Going for the cheese while also staring at herself in the mirror. Classic.</span>

                    <p>Once I got out of the refrigerated section the rest of the trip was a breeze. <b>A tip for all you stay-at-home not moms out there, shop in the aisles where your purse straps aren't long enough to knock shit over! </b>Who knew. The things we have to put up with, man. Anyway, I sped through the rest of my trip and my cart was perfectly organized. Like, not one thing was out of place or put in my cart that I didn't want. Weird, right? I dealt with it. It's one of those moments as a stay-at-home not mom where you just have to find your zen and remember everything is going to be ok.</p>

                    <p>My trip was so drama-free and I had way too much 'me time', not to mention no crying not-kids. But despite all that, right before I left, I stopped to soak in the scenery, just my not-kids and me, chillin' in Sprouts. It's the little things, ya know?</p>

                    <img class="img-responsive" src="img/groceryshopping/aisle.jpg" alt="">
                    <span class="caption text-muted">Such a proud not-mom moment.</span>

                    <p>I hope me sharing this with all you other not-moms encourages you to be the best stay-at-home not mom you can be. Remember, we aren't perfect. Sometimes, we only spend $40 on groceries for the week. Strangers <i>don't</i> stare at us. But that's ok, because at the end of the day we cherish what's really important....</p>

                    <p>Sleep. Lots of long, uninterrupted sleep.</p>
